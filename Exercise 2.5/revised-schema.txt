The application has the following entities:

User: This entity represents the users of the application. It has attributes like id, username, and password. The id is a unique identifier for each user, the username is the name the user uses to log into the application, and the password is used for authentication.

Recipe: This entity represents individual recipes. It has attributes id, user_id, title, description, cooking_time, and difficulty. The id is a unique identifier for each recipe, the user_id is a foreign key linking the recipe to the user that created it, title is the name of the recipe, description provides an overview or summary of the recipe, cooking_time is the amount of time it takes to prepare and cook the recipe, and difficulty is the complexity level of the recipe, automatically calculated by the application.

Ingredient: This entity represents the individual ingredients that can be used in recipes. It has attributes id and name. The id is a unique identifier for each ingredient and name is the name of the ingredient (like 'sugar', 'salt', 'apple', etc.).

RecipeIngredient: This entity establishes a many-to-many relationship between the Recipe and Ingredient entities. It has attributes id, recipe_id, ingredient_id, and quantity. The id is a unique identifier for each recipe-ingredient relationship, recipe_id is a foreign key linking to the recipe in which an ingredient is used, ingredient_id is a foreign key linking to the ingredient used in a recipe, and quantity is the amount of the ingredient used in the recipe.

The RecipeIngredient entity is crucial to the database design because it allows us to create complex many-to-many relationships between Recipe and Ingredient in a way that's efficient and easily queryable.
